title: Creating a Magnetic Compass in P5JS
---

I have been dabbling in 3D modelling with Blender ((https://blender.org)) with a view to bring some historical instruments and experiments to life. I was very excited when I discovered that there are javascript libraries such as (threejs.org) that can directly import entire scenes from Blender. Threejs seemed a bit complicated to start with when I'm still very new to javascript itself. So I decided to take my first little dips with a javascript library that couldn't be any friendlier, P5JS ( (https://p5js.org) ).
